#1 Function Prototypes
The function prototypes are used to tell the compiler about the number of arguments and about the required datatypes of a function parameter, it also tells about the return type of the function. By this information, the compiler cross-checks the function signatures before calling it.

#2 String functions in c

1)  strlen(string_name) : returns the length of string name.
2)	strcpy(destination, source)	: copies the contents of source string to destination string.
3)	strcat(first_string, second_string)	: concats or joins first string with second string. The result of the string is stored in first string.
4)	strcmp(first_string, second_string)	: compares the first string with second string. If both strings are same, it returns 0.
5)	strrev(string) : returns reverse string.
6)	strlwr(string) : returns string characters in lowercase.
7)	strupr(string) : returns string characters in uppercase.

#3 different ways in which a single dimensional array can be declared and initialized.

	int num[5] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
	int num[ ] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
	int num[100];
	int num[5] =  { };                // num = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
	int num[5] =  { 1 };             // num = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
#4 why goto should be avoided
	 GOTO statement is a control statement that is used to jump to a specific point in the code.
	Use of goto statement is highly discouraged in any programming language because it makes difficult to trace the control flow of a program, making the program hard to understand and hard to modify. Any program that uses a goto can be rewritten to avoid them.

#5 Functions
		
	C programming makes use of modularity to remove the complexity of a program. The programmer divides the program into different modules or functions and accesses certain functions when needed.A function is basically a block of statements that performs a particular task. 
	Every C program has at least one function. The most common function that we use in our day-to-day programming is the main() function. The compiler always executes the main() function first and then any other function(if it is called from the main method).


	• Use of functions enhances the readability of a program. A big code is always difficult to read. Breaking the code in smaller Functions keeps the program organized, easy to understand and makes it reusable.
	• The C compiler follows top-to-down execution, so the control flow can be easily managed in case of functions. The control will always come back to the main() function.
	• It reduces the complexity of a program and gives it a modular structure.
	• In case we need to test only a particular part of the program we will have to run the whole program and figure out the errors which can be quite a complex process. Another advantage here is that functions can be individually tested which is more convenient than the above mentioned process.
	• A function can be used to create our own header file which can be used in any number of programs i.e. the reusability.

#6 why fgets is  better for strings

	If you type more than four characters then the extra characters and the null terminator will be written outside the end of the array, overwriting memory not belonging to the array. This is a buffer overflow.

	C does not prevent you from clobbering memory you don't own. This results in undefined behavior. Your program could do anything—it could crash, it could silently trash other variables and cause confusing behavior, it could be harmless, or anything else. Notice that there's no guarantee that your program will either work reliably or crash reliably. You can't even depend on it crashing immediately.

	This is a great example of why scanf("%s") is dangerous and should never be used. It doesn't know about the size of your array which means there is no way to use it safely. Instead, avoid scanf and use something safer, like fgets():

#7 Relationship between array and pointers

	Array is a data structure that hold finite sequeential collection of similar data type.

	Array elements are sequentially stored in memory.

	The name of the array is a pointer to the first element of the array. That means it holds the address of the very first element of the array. 
	All array names will implicitly convert to a pointer to the first element in the array when an array name  appears as an argument to a
	function
